# pdf_notes
Extract highlights and notes from PDF files.

pdf_notes.py can be run as a Python app:

python pdf_notes.py

Or, a Windows executable can be created by:

pyinstaller --onefile pdf_notes.py

And then pdf_notes.exe can be run like any Windows app.

There are 2 options: you can select an entire folder or a set of files. 
When choosing a folder pdf_notes will find any files with the .pdf extension.

All pretty self-explanatory.
